This directory contains examples of codes which use 
ROOT subroutines to construct histograms. You can also run 
directly in ROOT (see the ../root directory for details), 
however for long 
simulation it is often better to run in batch mode.


You need to have the ROOT pachage installed on your computer for 
the following to work.

 The file fusion.cpp is an example of a simulation of
 heavy-ion fusion reaction producing a compound nucleus
 which statistically decay.
There is a similar file fusionThick.cpp


These programs  call either Run.cpp or RunThick.cpp which
constructs various histograms and runs the simulations.
Run.cpp is for a thin target - only one compound nucleus excitation energy
RunThick.cpp is for a thicker target, but thin enough so that the energy loss
of the projectile is approximately uniform thoughout the target thickness.
It then calcuates the decay for a small range of excitation energies. 


Instructions

a) copy the files in this directory to the main gemini++ deirectory or better
a copy of the main gemini++ directory

b) Makefile fusion

c ./fusion
