This directory contains GEMINI++, a c++ version of GEMINI
used to model the statistical decay of a compound nuclei.

The main c++ class is CNucleus. An example of how to use
this is a c++ program can be found in testDecay.cpp.

The file gemini.cpp is for fortran users. An example of how to use 
this in a fortran program can be found in testGemini.f

These two example programs can be compiled with
make testDecay
or
make testGemini

Note the directories tbl and tl contain input data which are
read in each time one uses these classes. Use can use the variable GINPUT 
to point to the gemini directory if you are not running the code in this
directory. Use the export command 
.e.q. in .bashrc I have set
export GINPUT=/home/charity/gemini++
