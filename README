This directory contains GEMINI++, a c++ version of GEMINI
used to model the statistical decay of a compound nuclei.

The main c++ class is CNucleus. An example of how to use
this is a c++ program can be found in testDecay.cpp.

Another example for the statistical decay of a compound nucleus formed
in a heavy-ion fusion reaction can be found in testFusion.cpp

The file gemini.cpp is for fortran users. An example of how to use 
this in a fortran program can be found in testGemini.f

These three example programs can be compiled with
make testDecay
or
make testGemini
or 
Make testFusion

Note the directories tbl and tl contain input data which are
read in each time one uses these classes. Use can use the variable GINPUT 
to point to the gemini directory if you are not running the code in this
directory. Use the export command 
.e.q. in .bashrc I have set
export GINPUT=/home/charity/gemini++



More details can be found in the doxygen documentation
i.e in directory html try
firefox index.html


GEMINI++ can be run in the root envirament. Instructions can be 
found in root/readme.
For long simulations is can be better to run in batch,
 root2/readme2 give an example of a program that calls gemini++
and histograms using ROOT classes and write out a root file of the 
results.
